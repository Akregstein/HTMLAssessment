#Overview

This project was my first introduction to working with HTML. In it I displayed a title and multiple multiple headers. I displayed three paragraphs of text and utilized different tools to make words bold and italicized.
Then I created a Table that displayed two football teams and displayed their scores for a game. After Some lists were created with logos and links that lead to the football teams websites. Finally There was interactive forms at the bottom of the page in which a viewer can input data.

#Lessons Learned

Everything in this project was the first time utilizing HTML technology. Even though it has a simplicity to it I still struggled remembering some of the tags and the appropriate way to link to an image. It was very good practice playing around with rowspan and colspan to view different outputs when working with the Table.
